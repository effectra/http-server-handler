## Version 2.0.0

### Added

- Introduced a new private property `lastRequest` of type `ServerRequestInterface` to store the last processed request.
- Implemented the `RequestHandlerInterface` to adhere to the standardized request handling protocol.

### Updated

- Modified the constructor to include the `ResponseInterface $response` and `array $stack` parameters.
- The `handle` method now assigns the incoming request to the `lastRequest` property before processing the middlewares stack.
- Inside the `handle` method, the response generated by the middlewares stack is now assigned to a local variable `$response` before being returned.
- Added a new public method `getLastRequest` to retrieve the last processed request. It returns a `ServerRequestInterface|null`, representing the last request or `null` if no request has been processed.

These changes enhance the `RequestHandler` class by providing the ability to track and retrieve the last processed request through the `getLastRequest` method. Additionally, the implementation of the `RequestHandlerInterface` ensures compatibility with standardized request handling practices.
